My E-Porfolio

This is my website where I will keep all my information on what I am working on and have worked on.
It was initially just developed using HTML/CSS and running in the NGINX web server.
Now I am developing it to use a C++ API framework called Drogon to make HTTP requestsand dynamically build the site.
The goal for this is to keep building on to it and use it as a learning tool and a place where I can try new projects out that I want to work on.

Thank you for visiting my website. Come back soon to see what's changed.
