	<h4>School Assignments</h4>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Fantasy E-Sports App:</b> This was done in java and at first was going to just be a terminal application but shifted to adding in a UI. In this group project I worked on designing the architeture, helping with the implementing the database and making the unit tests. This was made with Java.</li>
		<li><b>Duesytech:</b> This is a tech matching and tech tools/products store. It is an app were you can look for techs to help you with jobs that you need to get done and offer them jobs. The techs can then acccept or reject them and the two can discuss the pay. There is also a store that the techs can use to get products.<p>In this project I worked on the backend API calls for the tech matching part and a bit of the store. This was made with C# and nodejs in the back-end and Vuejs in the front-end<p></li>
		</ul>
