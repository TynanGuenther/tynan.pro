	<h2>Hi, Welcome To My Personal Website</h2>
	<p>	My name is Tynan and I am a software developer and a bit of a Linux nerd. I love to learn about everything Linux from the kernel to just playing with different ditros. I am currently working as a Student Assistant Researcher but also looking for a better fitting role for myself. I currently do research and work with ML and AI, testing and training different models. I find it interesting but am looking for more of a software developer role with languages like C and Nim. I am also very interested in system administration with Linux. If you are looking to hire someone like me check out my <a href="/resume" class="ml">Resume</a>.
	<p>	I am also currently a member of the Regina Thunder Football team and love the game. I play offensive tackle and was part of 2 undefeated regular season teams (2021, 2022) coming up short by 2 points in the national championship in 2022. This team has meant so much to me and I have learned a lot of lessons, from learning how to be a leader to how to be disciplined. I am also a big outdoorsman, even though I haven't been able to do as much since I moved to the city, I still love hunting and fishing. With all that fun stuff in my free time I stay pretty busy and love to spend it all with friends that enjoy those activities as well.</p>
